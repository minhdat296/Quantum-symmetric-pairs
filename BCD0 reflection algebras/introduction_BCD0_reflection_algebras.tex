    \subsection{Notations}
        If $A$ is an algebra (not even necessarily associative or unital) with multiplication $\mu: A \tensor A \to A$, then its \textbf{opposite algebra} shall be denoted by $A^{\op}$. This object has the same underlying vector space, but the opposite multiplication is now given by $\mu^{\op} := \mu \circ \tau_{1, 2}$, wherein $\tau_{1, 2}: A \tensor A \xrightarrow[]{\cong} A \tensor A$ is the isomorphism given by $\tau_{1, 2}(x \tensor y) := y \tensor x$. Likewise, if $C$ is a coalgebra with comultiplication $\Delta: C \to C \tensor C$, then its \textbf{(co-)opposite} shall be denoted by $C^{\cop}$; the co-opposite multiplication is given by $\Delta^{\cop} := \tau_{1, 2} \circ \Delta$. These notions generalise in a straightforward manner to the setting of topological (co)algebras.
